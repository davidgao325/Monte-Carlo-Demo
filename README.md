# Monte-Carlo-Demo

In this demo, small sample sizes were used to construct a simulation to visualize results for a normal distribution.

Later on, the Beta-Binomial and Monte Carlo Simulations were also performed on a small smaple size, to visualize the densities
on various graphs, such as histograms and density graphs. It was also used to compare the results and see the similarities. At the end,
I found that using qbeta and monte carlo simulation produce similar results.
